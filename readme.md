# Sourcetree For Windows - Merge Conflict Resolution problems

This repository illustrates a short-coming in SourceTree for Windows where the type of merge is not explained well by the UI and the external merge tool will fail.

# Instructions

1. Checkout this repository
2. Checkout `master` branch
3. Merge `other_branch` into `master`
4. Observe the lack of distinction in the **SourceTree** tree.
